# Music Shop Website

The foundational building block of any website would be Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a standard markup language that makes use of a wide variety of elements, including headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images and forms to structure content. HTML works in close relation with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which defines and applies styles consistently across all pages of a website. This results in shaping user-friendly and attractive web pages. Additionally, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSLT) complement each other to transform and present data. The Document Type Definition (DTD) helps validate and constrain XML structures. The project, Rustic Rhythms, is a simulated multi-page music record store website. It implements and transforms knowledge from HTML, CSS, XML, XSLT and DTD, resulting in a website that is interactive in nature. Each page demonstrates specific web development skills: 
- HTML includes paragraphs, lists, tables, headings, and  more, and CSS applies consistent design to the pages, providing a clean look. 
- Two XML files store the music record data, which is validated through the DTD file. 
- Both XML data is transformed into readable and stylized tables, formatted using XSLT.
