# CPU Scheduling Algorithm

This project involves creation of three CPU scheduling algorithms using Python:
- First Come First Serve
- Shortest Job First
- Round Robin
By taking up the task, it ensures theoretical and practical understanding of the algorithms. The basic concepts of Python were also required to be implemented.

## Instructions:
1. Download the 'CPU_Scheduling_Algorithm.zip' from GitHub. Next, unzip the folder's contents.
2. Open the files in Python IDE.
3. Run the program and follow the instructions shown in the terminal.
